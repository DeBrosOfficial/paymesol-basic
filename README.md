# Payme.sol: Your Gateway to Fast, Secure, Decentralized Payments on Solana

Payme.sol is a mobile decentralized application (dApp) that simplifies receiving payments on the Solana blockchain. Available in **Basic** (free with limited transactions) and **Pro** (advanced features with a 0.5% per transaction fee) versions, Payme.sol enables small business owners and individuals to accept payments effortlessly. Generate QR codes containing payment details, such as amount and wallet address, which customers can scan using their smartphone camera. The QR code opens their Phantom wallet with pre-filled details eliminating manual input and reducing errors.

Payme.sol is fully decentralized, requiring no personal information, subscriptions, or user data. Use it freely at your own responsibility. The **Basic** version is open-source to ensure transparency and trust, with its code available at [https://git.debros.io/DeBros/paymesol-basic](https://git.debros.io/DeBros/paymesol-basic). The **Pro** version, while not open-source, maintains the same high security standards. Payme.sol currently supports Euro-to-crypto conversions for Basic, and Euro, US Dollar, and Dirham for Pro, with plans to expand currency support in the future.
